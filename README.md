# Introduction to sc-REnF


An Entropy Based Feature Selection- Application on Single cell RNA Sequence Data

# Summary


A novel and Robust Entropy based Feature (gene) Selection method for large Single-cell RNA-seq data, using  Renyi Â´and Tsallis entropy. The SC-REnF is also demonstrated for identifying marker genes from different cell types. Our results shed some light on the single-cell clustering problem with the application of entropy based feature selection, and therefore, it will be an important tool to complement existing methods in the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. Results are shown here in brief.
